# Simple-Bank-Management-System

## 1. Overview

This is a simple C-based banking system that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking their balance, depositing funds, and withdrawing money. The system is designed for console-based interaction and ensures proper handling of user inputs.

### 1.1 Learning Outcomes

I created this project for educational purposes. By working through this implementation, you will gain knowledge in the following fundamental C programming concepts:

- **Variables & Data Types** – Understanding how to store and manage different data types.
- **Formatted Output (printf)** – Displaying information in a structured and user-friendly format.
- **User Input Handling (scanf)** – Receiving user input and safely processing it.
- **Looping (while loop)** – Implementing continuous user interactions.
- **Buffer Clearing (while and getchar)** – Preventing unwanted input buffering issues.
- **Conditional Statements (if, if-else)** – Making decisions based on user choices.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations** – Performing calculations for deposits and withdrawals.
- **Program Logic Design** – Structuring a functional and interactive program.

### 1.2 Challenge Level

This project is **beginner-friendly** and serves as an excellent starting point for those looking to enhance their understanding of **C programming fundamentals and logical problem-solving**. It introduces key programming concepts in a **structured and practical manner**, making it ideal for learners with **basic C knowledge**.

### 1.3 Learning Duration

The project is designed to be **completed within 6-8 hours**, depending on the learner’s familiarity with C programming. This estimation includes **coding, debugging, and testing** but **does not include** additional time for **presentation or documentation**.

## 2. Features

- Initial balance starts at $1000.00.
- User-friendly menu with four operations:
    1. Check Balance
    2. Deposit Money
    3. Withdraw Money
    4. Exit the System
- Error handling for invalid inputs.
- Ensures valid deposit and withdrawal amounts to prevent incorrect transactions.
- Lightweight and efficient C implementation.
